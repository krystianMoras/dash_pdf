Pdf loading, and annotating in dash

Work in progress, however if you really need it now, pdf loading should be supported.
Feel free to contribute/fork, I don't plan on maintaining this in future, I just made it for demo on one of my projects.

This project was forked from https://github.com/thedirtyfew/dash-extensions because instructions on dash.plotly page are deprecated. Therefore there might be a lot of unnecessary things, I am completely new to React and js in general.
